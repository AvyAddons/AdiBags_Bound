# AdiBags Bound
> Filters for BoE, BoA, and Soulbound categories in [AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags).

By default, the addon will only sort BoE and BoA. Soulbound items can be
be filtered by equipable status as well, so that only gear will be moved.

This is a plugin only! You can get the base bag addon over at [AdiAddons/AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags).
